This is a project I created for people who love Chinese stories but don't know Chinese. The project is divided into two main parts:

Data Collection – A tool to automatically scrape story content from piaotia.com.
Translation – Utilizing the free API from Gemini to translate stories from Chinese to English, making them more accessible to readers.
My goal is to provide a seamless and convenient reading experience for those passionate about Chinese literature but hindered by language barriers.
