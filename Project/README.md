# 🚢 Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster 🏆

## 📌 Introduction
This project participates in the **"Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster"** challenge on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic), where the goal is to build a predictive model to determine which passengers survived the Titanic disaster.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand and explore the **Titanic dataset**.
- Apply **data preprocessing** techniques such as handling missing values and feature engineering.
- Train **Machine Learning models** to predict passenger survival.
- Generate a **submission file** for Kaggle.

## 📂 Project Structure
```
├── Titanic.ipynb       # Main Jupyter Notebook for analysis and modeling
├── train.csv           # Training dataset (provided by Kaggle)
├── test.csv            # Test dataset (provided by Kaggle)
├── submission.csv      # Sample submission file for Kaggle
├── README.md           # Project documentation
```

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas, NumPy** (Data manipulation)
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** (Data visualization)
- **Scikit-Learn** (Machine Learning)

## 🚀 How to Run
1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
   ```
2. **Run the Jupyter Notebook (`Titanic.ipynb`)**.
3. **Train the model and generate predictions for submission**.

## 📊 Workflow
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding the dataset and its features.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature selection.
3. **Model Training & Evaluation**: Testing different models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM.
4. **Submission File Generation**: Creating `submission.csv` with predicted survival results.

## 🏅 Results & Evaluation
- The trained model’s performance can be assessed using **accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score**.
- The final predictions can be submitted to Kaggle for **leaderboard ranking**.
