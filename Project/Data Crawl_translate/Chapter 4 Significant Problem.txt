Lin Fan's dinner was simple: a bucket of instant noodles, plus a ham sausage and a braised egg. And of course, a bottle of iced cola. It all looked like junk food, utterly lacking in basic nutrition, but when you're reduced to eating instant noodles, who the hell cares about health?

    Sitting quietly in front of the computer, Lin Fan glanced at the instant noodle packaging and began to ponder a question... Is the cow on the instant noodle factory's side still alive?

    Perhaps,

    This might be the famous quantum mechanics thought experiment – Schrödinger's Cow. Maybe one day in the future... Schrödinger's Cow could even extend to other philosophical debates.

    Sluuurp ~ Sluuurp ~

    In the blink of an eye, Lin Fan had devoured his dinner and started his leisure time. Since coming to this world, he had begun to make up for the experiences he'd missed before, playing games like there's no tomorrow. Currently, Lin Fan's favorite game is World of Warcraft Classic.

    Night,

    Descended upon the city,

    After finishing the raid, Lin Fan silently shut down his computer... Just as he was about to go to bed, he glanced back at the door. Speaking of which... what was the refrigerator woman doing at this moment? Was she researching how to make things colder?

    Forget it... never mind her.

    Lying on his bed, Lin Fan was still wide awake, staring at the ceiling above him. His emotions slowly began to spiral out of control... Actually, his life was numb and hopeless. Every day he went to work on time, doing the same work as yesterday, then went home after work.

    In the dead of night, his emotions gradually flooded, even leading to insomnia. But by the next day... as twilight faded, everything would return to the original point as usual, day after day...

    Back to calmness,

    But calmness is too simple.

    Repetitive life, repetitive beginnings, in fact... this is not just Lin Fan's life alone, it's the life of most people. After all, life is already hard-pressed to give someone a surprise, as long as it's not a fright, that's good enough.

    Ding-dong~

    Lin Fan's phone rang with a notification sound. He picked it up and looked at it, finding it was a WeChat friend request.

    "Yun?"

    "Who is it?" Lin Fan looked at the profile picture and name, instinctively rejecting it. The reason for rejection was simple – sorry... don't buy tea.

    However,

    Not long after,

    He received another WeChat friend request, still from the woman named Yun, but her introduction had changed.

    [I am Liu Yun'er]

    The refrigerator?

    What's she adding me for?

    Lin Fan was momentarily confused. He couldn't figure out what the refrigerator was up to.  Was she attracted to his handsome face? Didn't seem like it... To be honest, Liu Yun'er, aside from her refrigerator-like face, was quite pretty. A woman like that... had no reason to fixate on him. She should have plenty of suitors.

    Uh...

    Hard to say!

    These days... there are too few repairmen who can fix refrigerators that use Freon.

    After pondering for a while,

    Lin Fan still accepted the friend request.

    AwesomeTian·Niveisenmok·Lamoshuai: Hello...

    Yun: Asking you something!

    Lin Fan frowned. This woman wasn't playing by the rules, not even following the most basic online chatting etiquette... coming straight to the point, who could handle that?

    AwesomeTian·Niveisenmok·Lamoshuai: Could you please show some respect for online chatting?

    Yun: Stop talking nonsense!

    Yun: What's your education level?

    Huh?

    Education level?

    Why ask about education level?

    Lin Fan's past education was quite high, but his current education was a bit low.  In the past, Lin Fan had been quite puzzled.  He had transmigrated... logically, he should be a non-citizen, right? But when he checked his ID card, good heavens... high school graduate, university dropout, and from an orphanage.

    Later, he understood.

    His arrival might have triggered a concept in chaos theory... called initial-condition sensitivity, also known as the butterfly effect. It had disrupted the structure of this spacetime.

    AwesomeTian·Niveisenmok·Lamoshuai: High school!

    Yun: High school?

    Yun: I don't believe it.

    AwesomeTian·Niveisenmok·Lamoshuai: Believe it or not, goodbye!

    Tch!

    Whatever!  This grandpa isn't serving you!

    Sleep!

    At the same time,

    In room 305, directly across from 304.

    Liu Yun'er's face instantly darkened after receiving Lin Fan's reply. The air in the room began to solidify, emitting a terrifying aura... an aura called killing intent.

    Enraged,

    Liu Yun'er was exceptionally angry.  Finally, anger broke through the cage of reason, directly occupying Liu Yun'er's entire brain.

    She walked out of her room and came to the door of 304.

    Bang bang bang!

    A series of rapid knocks echoed.

    However,

    There was no response.

    This undoubtedly added fuel to the fire, making the flame already burning in her heart blaze even more fiercely.

    Bang bang bang!

    Another series of rapid knocks echoed,

    Finally, there was a reaction.

    The door of room 304 was secretly opened a crack. Through the crack, she saw a man standing behind the door, with a hint of fear and bewilderment in his eyes.

    "Can you be a little more honest?" Liu Yun'er questioned sternly, "Would I believe you're a high school graduate?"

    Lin Fan didn't know what to say for a moment. After pondering for a long time... he said cautiously, "Big sister... there are many incomprehensible things in this world, but not everything needs to be figured out. To give you an example... I'm obviously so handsome, yet I'm just a librarian, and a temporary one at that."

    "Don't you feel it's incredible?" Lin Fan shrank his head and continued, "Give life a little room for imagination, what do you think?"

    "Good night!"

    "Wish you have sweet dreams!"

    Clap,

    The crack was closed.

    Liu Yun'er was stunned at this moment... completely stunned for about ten seconds. But then she suddenly realized, it sounded like it made some sense, full of life's insights, but in reality... it was just a bunch of nonsense!

    Bang bang bang,

    Rapid knocks sounded again, but the door of 304 was never opened again.

    Bang!

    A loud noise,

    Liu Yun'er kicked the door of 304 hard. A trace of pain spread throughout her body, making Liu Yun'er, who had lost her rationality, become much more sober. She was filled with confusion about her previous behavior. When had she ever been so失态 [shītài - lose composure]? But why, ever since she met this guy named Lin Fan, had she lost control of her emotions several times?

    "Crazy person!"

    "Aren't you going to sleep at this hour?"

    A roar came from the hallway, interrupting Liu Yun'er who was contemplating life. She pursed her lips... and silently returned to her room.

    However,

    The seeds of hatred had already been planted.

    Inside room 304,

    Lin Fan was wrapped in his quilt, huddled in the corner against the wall, his face filled with fear of the unknown. He couldn't help but recall a quote, "The oldest and strongest emotion of mankind is fear, and the oldest and strongest kind of fear is fear of the unknown."

    Oh my god!

    What does this woman want to do?

    Is she even going to let people live?

    ...

    Lin Fan's biological clock was always very accurate. He woke up at seven o'clock on the dot, quickly washed up, and then took the second bus, arriving at work at exactly 7:45, basically every day, rain or shine.

    Unfortunately,

    He might be late today. Well... yesterday's hellish experience made Lin Fan overthink until the second half of the night. Even an iron body couldn't withstand such torment.

    Hurriedly opening the door, he looked up and saw a refrigerator standing at the door...

    No,

    It was Liu Yun'er.

    "No way?"

    "Am I hallucinating?" Lin Fan quickly closed the door, then opened it again. That 'refrigerator' was still there...

    At this moment,

    The atmosphere was slightly awkward.

    ......
