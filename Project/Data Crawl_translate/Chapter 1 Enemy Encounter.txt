Mid-March,

    The weather was still a bit chilly.

    Lin Fan sat on a chair, losing control of his emotions 16 times, his heart beating 2671 times. This marked his 60th day in a daze, engaging in deep thought for 28800 seconds (8 hours), and the question he pondered was profound: Is there some kind of connection between two worlds?

    The answer was affirmative.

    Because Lin Fan had encountered such a thing, and the plot was quite cliché, albeit with a hint of the extraordinary within the cliché. He was hit by a Mercedes-Benz G-Wagon, not a seven-figure Mercedes-Benz G-Class SUV, but a three-digit children's electric toy car.

    Waking up, he found himself in a bizarre place, still named Lin Fan, still so devastatingly handsome, still so intelligent, but... he had become an orphan of Zu'an (Zu'an is a place known for its...er...unique local culture).

    Thinking about it was infuriating. As the "child of someone else's family" in the mouths of strangers from his past life, Lin Fan had carried the moniker of "genius" since childhood. He was almost always first in his grade, smoothly entered MIT, then became a Doctor of Science, returned to China for work, and soon after received the Outstanding Young Investigator Award.

    Originally, he thought his path would be smooth sailing, without any thorns.

    But as a result...

    Suddenly, he embarked on a completely new life, and the starting point of this life was as a librarian at a certain university branch.

    Just as Lin Fan was lost in his thoughts, a middle-aged man in a janitorial uniform appeared beside him, unnoticed, a smile plastered on his face. This smile looked somewhat creepy, as if concealing a shocking conspiracy.

    “Little Lin... are you free at noon?” the middle-aged man asked.

    “What is it?”

    “Is there something you need, Uncle?” Lin Fan was pulled back to reality, looking at the middle-aged man before him. His name was Liu Zhongtao... the director of the branch library. Perhaps their brainwaves were aligned, because ever since Lin Fan arrived here as a temporary worker, he had often received care from Liu Zhongtao.

    Initially, Lin Fan suspected that the other party was lusting after his body, otherwise, why would he take such good care of him? Later, he realized... Liu Zhongtao was a righteous person, not the kind he had imagined. On the contrary, he was judging a gentleman's heart with a petty person's mind.

    “I want to introduce you to a young lady,” Liu Zhongtao said with a chuckle, “I remember you are twenty-five this year, right? Coincidentally… she’s twenty-eight this year. As the saying goes, ‘Marrying a woman three years older is like holding a golden brick.’ This time, you’re going to pick up a golden brick.”

    “Blind date?” Lin Fan was taken aback, then said helplessly, “My monthly salary is only three thousand… am I even qualified for a blind date?”

    “Ai!”

    “That’s just being vulgar, lowbrow, and pandering to bad taste. Love isn’t something that can only be possessed with material things. Sometimes, it depends on that instant feeling,” Liu Zhongtao said earnestly, “Your Aunt and I fell in love at first sight. Back then, I was as poor as dirt, while her family was a bit well-off, but didn’t we still end up getting married?”

    Lin Fan sighed, not knowing what to do, and finally nodded, “Okay…”

    Actually, Lin Fan didn’t want to go, but he usually received too many favors from Liu Zhongtao, so he could only reluctantly agree.

    “Good, good, good!”

    “This is just too great!” Liu Zhongtao hurriedly took out his phone, seemingly searching for something, and said, “Twelve noon, Peninsula Boutique Western Restaurant. You go a little earlier. I’ll find someone to cover your shift at the library. Oh right… I also booked a seat for you. And this is her phone number, write it down… I’ve given her your phone number.”

    Huh?

    Something feels a little off!

    Lin Fan looked at Liu Zhongtao with a blank face. This strange enthusiasm… helping to introduce a girl, and even helping to book a restaurant, what exactly is Uncle up to?

    …

    Eleven fifty AM,

    Lin Fan was running towards the school gate like crazy. That’s right… he was going to be late. Fortunately, he had checked the address of that restaurant while at work, it didn’t seem too far from the school. As long as he ran with all his might, he should be able to reach his destination in ten minutes.

    “Ouch!”

    Lin Fan violently collided with an unknown object and then fell heavily to the ground.

    In that instant,

    Lin Fan thought he might be going home, back to his original world.

    However,

    He was thinking too much.

    “You…” A woman stood up, looking pained. Seeing a white Audi A4 parked in front of him, a woman got out of the car, to be precise, a beautiful young lady, estimated to be 165cm tall, with particularly delicate features, but giving off a somewhat aloof and cold feeling.

    “Are you alright?” Her tone carried a hint of inhuman coldness, which matched her exquisite refrigerator face quite well.

    “I…”

    Lin Fan was about to argue with her, but suddenly remembered he had urgent matters, so he casually said, “I’m fine, forget it, forget it…”

    He got up and was about to run,

    But was stopped by the young lady.

    “Wait a minute!”

    “You’ve damaged my car.” The young lady still glared at Lin Fan coldly, then spat out two words, “You need to pay for damages!”

    Lin Fan was stunned, standing there for a full five seconds before finally reacting, and angrily said, “You… are you a lunatic? I haven’t asked you to compensate me, and you want me to compensate you? Believe it or not, I’ll lie down right here!”

    As he spoke,

    He glanced at the time,

    Crap… only five minutes left!

    “Or why don’t you just call the police and say I’m committing a hit-and-run.”

    After saying that,

    Lin Fan took off, leaving behind a panicked and reckless back view.

    With great effort,

    He finally arrived at the reserved restaurant at twelve o’clock sharp, as agreed. At this moment, Lin Fan was constantly panting, collapsing dead onto the chair. But thinking about what just happened, he felt angry. Seeing that woman seemed quite intelligent, how could she do something as foolish as a fool?

    Just a few seconds after sitting down, his phone rang, it was Liu Zhongtao calling.

    “Little Lin?”

    “Has the young lady arrived yet?” Liu Zhongtao asked.

    “Not yet.” Lin Fan said helplessly, “It’s just me here right now.”

    “Then wait a little while, I’ll urge her from my end.” Liu Zhongtao said with a smile, “By the way, Little Lin, you must seize this opportunity, don’t miss it…”

    “Oh…”

    After speaking,

    The sound of ‘beep beep beep’ came from the other end of the phone.

    Lin Fan looked at the disconnected call screen, he always felt something was not right, but he couldn’t quite put his finger on it.

    He sighed,

    Composed his inner turmoil, and quietly waited for the other party’s arrival. Actually, at this moment, Lin Fan was still quite expectant, after all, it was his first blind date in this life. But this expectation soon vanished, Lin Fan knew… the greater the hope, the greater the disappointment.

    In short… just take it lightly.

    After waiting for fifteen minutes,

    A woman entered the restaurant, and Lin Fan happened to glance at her. In an instant… he was completely speechless. Wasn’t she the refrigerator-face woman who bumped into him? Why would she be here? Damn it… could she be here to collect debts?

    Suddenly,

    Their eyes met, and in this moment, when enemies meet on a narrow path, the brave one wins (idiom meaning to stand your ground in a confrontation). Lin Fan did not choose to back down, but looked at her with a firm expression, while silently chanting in his heart, "Justice will prevail."

    Immediately after…

    That refrigerator-face woman took out her phone, seemingly dialing a number.

    Subsequently,

    Lin Fan’s phone, unwillingly rang at the most inopportune moment.

    ......
