“Hello… Did you have a good dream yesterday?”

    After Lin Fan casually asked this question, he wished he could slap himself twice. Why would he ask something like that… It was obvious that this woman was in a bad mood last night, and he actually asked her if she had a good dream? Wasn't that adding fuel to the fire?

    As expected,

    When Liu Yun’er heard Lin Fan’s words, her face changed slightly, becoming even colder.

    Looking at Liu Yun’er staring at him, that almost judgmental gaze… made Lin Fan’s heart palpitate. It felt as if he was standing stark naked in front of her, displaying everything he had to her eyes.

    “I think…”

    “There might be some misunderstanding between us, and this misunderstanding might affect the neighborly relationship.” Lin Fan said softly, “As the saying goes, a close neighbor is better than a distant relative, how about… we resolve this misunderstanding?”

    Liu Yun’er didn't speak, staring intently at the man in front of her who had made her lose composure multiple times. Apart from a somewhat handsome appearance, he didn't seem to have any other special qualities. No… there was also that mysterious and unfathomable physics knowledge. But even so… it shouldn't be that every time she saw him, she felt a bellyful of anger.

    “Did you drop offline?” Lin Fan asked curiously, “Can you reconnect?”

    “I will make you pay the price!”

    Liu Yun’er blurted out this sentence unexpectedly, then turned around and left the stairwell, leaving Lin Fan standing there alone, at a loss.

    “Hmph!”

    “What storms haven’t I weathered? Am I afraid of you?” Lin Fan didn’t care about the threat from a refrigerator. He believed that the light of righteousness would always shine upon the earth.

    Since he was a bit late for work, Lin Fan had no choice but to ride a public electric bike. Although five minutes for one yuan was a bit expensive, it was still better than being late and getting fined a hundred yuan. After searching for four or five bikes, he finally found one with sufficient battery.

    Just as he unlocked the electric bike by the roadside, he saw the refrigerator Liu Yun’er driving her Audi A4, heading from the parking lot towards the main road. When she passed by Lin Fan, she deliberately stopped, and then the passenger window slowly lowered.

    “Forgot to tell you, you also skipped out on the bill yesterday.”

    Having said that,

    She drove off.

    “…”

    “Is this woman sent by heaven to torment me? Why is she so vindictive?” Lin Fan almost exploded on the spot, but there was no time for him to continue being angry. He silently got on the electric bike.

    Unknowingly, he arrived at an intersection and found that the motor vehicle lane was completely jammed. Well, it was a big city… traffic jams were normal. This road was never smooth during rush hour.

    Just then,

    Lin Fan spotted a familiar white Audi in the congested traffic.

    Slowly riding to the side of that Audi, Lin Fan knocked on the passenger window.

    Bang bang!

    The window slowly lowered,

    Lin Fan asked with a smile, “Traffic jam?”

    Liu Yun’er just glanced at him without speaking, but judging from her expression, she seemed a little angry.

    “Keep jamming slowly, I’ll go first!”

    Having said that,

    Lin Fan twisted the throttle and sped off with a hint of smugness on his face.

    Bang!

    Bang!

    Bang!

    The refrigerator-faced woman watched the departing figure gradually disappear from her sight, then fiercely pounded the steering wheel a few times.

    This guy,

    Is so cheap!

    …

    Safe and sound!

    Lin Fan smoothly arrived at his workplace and clocked in with just seconds to spare… then collapsed in a heap on his chair. In short, a beautiful day starts with paralysis.

    “Oh?”

    “Little Lin… you just started work, and you’re already collapsing again?”

    A young woman walked towards him with a slight smile. Her name was Wang Fangfang… also a library employee, but she was a permanent employee, with much better benefits than him, a temporary worker.

    Lin Fan and her were a bit at odds because Wang Fangfang always used her permanent employee status to show off from time to time. He particularly disliked this behavior of rigidly dividing people into ranks. But in reality, wasn’t society just like this?

    “Oh…”

    “Too tired, lying down for a bit.” Lin Fan glanced at the bouquet of flowers she was holding and asked curiously, “Sister Fangfang… did you buy these flowers yourself?”

    “These?”

    “Teacher Tian gave them to me.” Wang Fangfang sighed and said helplessly, “I receive flowers like this every day, and I don’t know how to deal with them anymore. You definitely can’t understand my pain…”

    Lin Fan awkwardly smiled and said, “I probably haven’t reached Sister Fangfang’s level yet.”

    Actually,

    Lin Fan knew Wang Fangfang’s tactics very well: cast a wide net, catch many fish, and choose the best one to follow… colloquially known as gold-digging. But based on Lin Fan’s own observation, it was possible that Wang Fangfang already had a boyfriend, but just hadn’t told everyone.

    “Little Lin!”

    “Let me tell you something, our college has hired a very young and very impressive female professor. She seems to have graduated with a doctorate from some branch of the University of California and has three years of research experience overseas.” Wang Fangfang said mysteriously, “Very impressive!”

    “Is it the University of California, Berkeley?” Lin Fan casually said.

    “Yes, yes, yes!”

    “It’s the University of California, Berkeley!” Wang Fangfang looked at Lin Fan in surprise, “Little Lin, not bad! You’re just a high school graduate, but you even know this!”

    “Hehe…”

    “Not bad, I guess.” Lin Fan responded casually.

    Actually,

    Lin Fan had once collaborated with a research team from the University of California, Berkeley. He was the project leader of that collaborative project. Of course, these things happened in another world and had never happened in this world.

    At some point, Wang Fangfang took out her phone and pointed the screen at Lin Fan, saying, “Look… it’s this person in the picture.”

    Lin Fan raised his head and casually glanced at it. In an instant… he was completely dumbfounded.

    This…

    How could this be?

    “What’s wrong with you?” Wang Fangfang saw Lin Fan trembling all over, as if he was caught in some kind of fear, and asked curiously, “Why are you shaking all over?”

    “I…”

    “Maybe I’m a bit cold.” Lin Fan didn’t know how to explain to Wang Fangfang. In short, this was all too magical and too sudden.

    Cold?

    This didn’t seem like the way someone would be cold… it was more like being possessed.

    Wang Fangfang was a bit confused, completely unable to figure out what was wrong with Lin Fan at this moment. He became like this after looking at a photo.

    Lin Fan pursed his lips, his brain working quickly. No, no, no… it’s definitely not the same person. How could this world be so small? Meeting her everywhere, it must just be a resemblance!

    “Sister Fangfang?”

    “What’s her name?” Lin Fan looked at Wang Fangfang, his eyes radiating a strong expectation, mixed with a hint of fear.

    “Her?”

    “Her name is Liu Yun’er.”

    …
