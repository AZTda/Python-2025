Gas Sensor Project for course : Advanced Scientific Python Programming Project

This project focuses on the analysis, preprocessing, and modeling of data collected from Metal Oxide Semiconductor (MOS) gas sensors. MOS sensors often exhibit drift, noise, and other artifacts, making them challenging but crucial for reliable gas detection and concentration estimation.

Key goals include:

Data cleaning and signal preprocessing
Feature extraction (time-domain or frequency-domain)
Gas classification or concentration regression
Model evaluation and performance analysis
Handling sensor drift or baseline shifts
